# Project Synopsis
GoalPost is an app that incentivizes users to help reach their goals. For example, if a group of friends wants to go to the gym 3 times a week for the rest of the quarter, they would enter that into the app, and if anybody gets lazy, that person would get charged a couple dollars which goes to a common pool. At the end of the goal period, the pool can be split between everybody for a nice dinner or donated to charity, incentivizing individuals to stick to their original goal posts through reminders and friendly competition.

Rough Implementation Plan:
- Login for profiles: 
Outsourced through gmail or facebook to handle authentication and be done securly
- Grouping: 
Have some kind of habit everyone has to do if they don't they put money into slush fund to be distributed at end or donated (for groups of 1 or optional for groups of multiple people)
- Each group has:
  List of people, activities, habit times and goal post times, reminders for activities through push, confirmation of completions through push, and tracking of money owed by each person
- Payment:
  At end of goal post challenge sort out who owes what money to make it as few easy transactions as possible
  If charity, we give list of charities to donate to
  Outsource charging and payment infrastructure to trusted api like venmo or paypal or square
