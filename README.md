 # Project Synopsis
GoalPost is a social app that incentivizes users to help reach their goals through collaborative dynamics and friendly competition :)

We all have goals or habits we want to achieve; going to the gym, meditating, reading, the list goes on. But it can often be hard to motivate ourselves when we go at it alone. So, we often turn to our friends to work together to hold each other accountable. These days though, especially as a college student, getting schedules to line up to do activities together can be difficult if not impossible. 

This is where GoalPost comes in. Through GoalPost, users can create goals, like going to the gym, for whatever timeframe however often they want and invite their friends to join them. Every day that people are supposed to go to the gym, they can check-in through the app and see how everyone else is doing. For those feeling extra daring, groups can also choose to specify a cash penalty for every missed event. All the money from these penalties will go into a pot that will be divided up at the end of the goal. Those who did better than average will make a profit, while those who did worse will end up at a loss. 

Changing ourselves for the better can be hard, GoalPost is here to help friends empower each other to create the changes they want to see in themselves.
