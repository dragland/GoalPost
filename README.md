# Project Synopsis
GoalPost is an app that incentivizes users to help reach their goals. For example, if a group of friends wants to go to the gym 3 times a week for the rest of the quarter, they would enter that into the app, and if anybody gets lazy, that person would get charged a couple dollars which goes to a common pool. At the end of the goal period, the pool can be split between everybody for a nice dinner or donated to charity, incentivizing individuals to stick to their original goal posts through reminders and friendly competition.
